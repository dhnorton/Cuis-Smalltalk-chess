# Cuis-Smalltalk-fen

Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation (FEN) is a standard notation for describing a particular board position of a chess game[1]. This package transforms a text file containing multiple groups of FEN records into a set of files named *.fen, which are compatible with XBoard, a graphical chessboard for the X Window System[2]. XBoard requires the first record of a *.fen file to define the position of pieces on the chess board. The records which follow are ignored.
