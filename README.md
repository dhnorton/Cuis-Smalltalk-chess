Utility programs for the study of the game of Chess. Classes and their purposes are as follows:

## InFen

Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation (FEN) is a standard notation for describing a particular board position of a chess game[1]. The InFen class transforms a text file containing multiple groups of FEN records into a set of files named *.fen, which are compatible with XBoard, a graphical chessboard for the X Window System[2]. XBoard requires the first record of a *.fen file to define the position of pieces on the chess board. The records which follow are ignored.

## Progress

The Progress class computes the winning percentage (as a decimal) of a series of win-loss pairs, such as may be encountered during "Tactics Training" at chesstempo.com[3].
